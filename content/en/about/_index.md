## Current status: ideas

We're just getting started with ideas. Team Open was
called into being September 13th 2019 and we're now
looking for like minded-people to join us. If that's you,
contact us! The details are on the [community page](/community).

## Why?

![The truth behind Open Source apps](/images/commitstrip-truthoss.png)
_&copy; 2014 [CommitStrip.com](https://www.commitstrip.com/en/2014/05/07/the-truth-behind-open-source-apps)_

Many open source projects do not receive the broad
support and contributions as the first picture of open
source would have you believe.

While a few maintainers dilligently offer their skills,
time and <abbr title="Opportunity cost being a large part of it.">money</abbr>
to build software we're all relying on,
the rewards are often more work, anxiety and guilt.

## What

This team is by and for the doers. _We start projects_
that are achievable right now and may provide help.
Any relief we can offer today is a win.

For the long term, we _spread the message_ and hope to
make clear, this is a serious problem we need to
address at a societal level.

### What about a discussion platform?

These exist, so while Team Open will likely have a good
amount of people to have in depth discussions with,
the primary goal is around moving into action.

I would encourage you to check out:
