You may have
[heard](https://nolanlawson.com/2017/03/05/what-it-feels-like-to-be-an-open-source-maintainer/),
[this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0t85TyH-h04),
[before](https://github.com/notify-rs/notify/issues/209).
Many maintainers working on OSS people depend upon are under
a lot of stress, responding to people's wants and needs, while doing
their best not to set the world on fire with breaking changes or security
vulnerabilities.

It's impressive how much great software is built this way,
but in the same breath, people have been pushing on to the
point where having **one or two episodes of burnout became normal**.

But what options are there for maintainers?
They may have realized it's causing them grief, but
posting an abandonment notice and hoping for the best&hellip;?
That seems like a last resort and something you could
feel quite guilty about doing.

## Project Lifeguard

What I feel is missing here, is a responsible way to leave your
maintainer position. **Giving _drowning maintainers_ an escape.**

The working idea I have now, is to be a group you can hand off
maintenance to which will offer:

1. Emergency bug and security fixes, by developers we find and pay?
1. A standard message asking for new maintainers and sponsors.
1. A long-term plan, to deprecate and archive if needed.

For sponsorships, in particular I think it would be good to look for businesses
that are using the software and derive value from it.

The standard message, could be used to _make risk a lot clearer_
for people using the software. Similar to an `npm audit`.
Or the sustainability information [proposed here](https://writing.kemitchell.com/2019/04/12/package-json-sustainability.html).
I'm imagining an output such as:

```
$ npm install
...
4 packages have been abandoned.
12 packages are receiving emergency maintenance.
